        <h2>Our History</h2> 
        
        <p class="herStory"> Informed by broad research encompassing critical theory, musical composition, literature and history, WALES BONNER embraces a multiplicity of perspectives, proposing a distinct notion of luxury, via a hybrid of European and Afro-Atlantic approaches.

            Grace Wales Bonner launched her eponymous label in 2014, following her graduation from Central Saint Martins. Established as a menswear brand, Wales Bonner’s soulful tailoring soon expanded to womenswear. In 2015, she was awarded Emerging Menswear Designer at the British Fashion Awards. In 2016, following her first solo runway presentation - Ezekiel, she received the LVMH Young Designer Prize. In 2019, Wales Bonner was invited by Maria Grazia Chiuri to collaborate with Dior to re-interpret their New Look silhouette for the Resort 2020 collection; shortly afterwards, she was announced the winner of the BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund.
            
            In January 2019, Grace Wales Bonner presented her first institutional exhibition, A Time for New Dreams at London’s Serpentine Galleries. She is an associate lecturer at Central Saint Martins, London and has lectured at Parsons School of Design, New York City.</p>
